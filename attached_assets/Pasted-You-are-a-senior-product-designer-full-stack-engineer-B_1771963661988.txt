You are a senior product designer + full-stack engineer. Build a modern, fast, mobile-first marketing website for my private soccer coaching business in Brooklyn, NY, primarily targeting parents of youth players (with a secondary audience of teen players). The site must feel high-trust: calm, clear, professional, warm, not salesy.

Primary goal

Convert parents into action via two CTAs:

Book a Session

Schedule a Call

Secondary goals

Build trust fast (credentials + testimonials + philosophy + what parents can expect)

Explain services (1-on-1 + small group)

Make it easy to contact me and understand logistics (Brooklyn, fields, ages, what to bring)

Local SEO (Brooklyn private soccer training, youth soccer coach Brooklyn, etc.)

Audience + Messaging Priorities

Write primarily to parents:

They care about: confidence, consistency, communication, safety, values, measurable progress, and their kid enjoying the game.

They want to know: “Will my child improve?”, “Will they feel supported?”, “Is this coach reliable and thoughtful?”, “What does a session look like?”, “How do we get started?”

Tone: direct, reassuring, competent. Avoid hype. Avoid “guarantees.” Make promises about process and standards, not outcomes.

Who I am (use this context)

Name: Ian Pollock
Location: Brooklyn, NY
Offer: private soccer coaching for youth players (all ages welcome), 1-on-1 and small group training.

Positioning:

I’m a highly experienced youth coach known for being positive, present, encouraging, and development-focused.

My coaching philosophy is inquiry-based: I help players learn to make decisions, solve problems, and grow their confidence through clarity and repetition.

I balance positive reinforcement + constructive feedback. I meet players where they are, then push them forward.

I emphasize technical execution + game understanding + confidence and translating training into game performance.

Credentials (include all)

Create a “Credentials & Safety” section near the top (after the hero or after testimonials).
Make credentials editable in a single config file / data object so I can easily update them.

Use a structured list with placeholders (do not invent credentials beyond what I explicitly confirm), but include a default set that I can toggle on/off:

US Soccer / USSF Coaching License: (placeholder: “C License” or “D License” etc.)

SafeSport Certified (toggle)

Background Check (toggle)

CPR / First Aid (toggle)

Concussion Awareness / Head Injury Training (toggle)

Coaching experience: (years placeholder)

Competitive playing background: (optional placeholder)

Add a note: “If you have questions about credentials or fit, schedule a quick call.”

Implementation requirement: credentials must live in data/credentials.ts (or similar) as an array of objects with label, status, details, enabled.

Expected outcomes (state clearly, parent-friendly)

Create a section: “What parents can expect” and “What players feel”.

Parents can expect:

Clear plan and feedback (what we’re working on + why)

Noticeable confidence growth (trying new things, less hesitation)

Better technical fundamentals (first touch, dribbling, passing, finishing)

Smarter decisions in games (scanning, composure, speed of play)

A coach who communicates consistently and shows up

Players feel:

More confident on the ball

Clearer in games (“I know what to do next”)

Proud of measurable progress

Avoid guarantees; use language like “most players experience…” and “you should expect…”

Testimonials (use these themes and quotes)

Create a parent-trust-heavy Testimonials section with:

One featured testimonial near top (“Hire him immediately and don’t turn back.”)

A grid/slider with at least 8

Use these real themes and representative quotes/paraphrases (rewrite lightly for polish, keep meaning):

“Wonderful… taught her a ton… always positive and present.”

“Always excited for games and practices… developed a ton in skill and confidence.”

“Confidence and love for the game started last season under Ian.”

“Consistent communication with parents… identified positives/negatives each game and kept the kids focused on improving.”

“Goes the extra mile… showed up to support players outside soccer.”

“Hire him immediately and don’t turn back.”

“You’d be lucky to have him!”

“100% hire him… positive, knowledgeable, goes the extra mile.”

“Great combination of intellect and soccer experience… mentor.”

Implementation requirement: testimonials in data/testimonials.ts as an array with name, relationship (Parent), quote, highlightTag.

Site structure (pages/sections)

Either multi-page or single-page with anchor navigation. Must have these:

Home

Hero:

Headline aimed at parents, local + outcome-based, e.g.

“Private Soccer Training in Brooklyn — Confidence, Technique, Game IQ”

Subheadline: parent-centric: development, confidence, game transfer, enjoyment

CTAs: Book a Session and Schedule a Call

Trust row: Brooklyn-based • Youth-focused • 1:1 + Small Groups • Credentials badges

Immediately after hero: a short “Why parents choose Ian” section (3–4 cards):

Calm, positive coaching

Clear communication with parents

Confidence + decision-making

Game-realistic training

Add a “How it Works” 3-step section:

Quick assessment (goals + baseline)

Training plan (skills + game habits)

Progress loop (repeat + measure)

Services

Two cards:

1-on-1 Private Training

Personalized plan, high reps, game-like decisions

Best for: confidence, rapid skill building, position-specific needs, tryout prep

Include examples of focus areas (first touch, dribbling under pressure, weak foot, finishing, scanning)

Small Group Training (2–6 players)

More competition, realism, reps, and decision-making

Best for: teammates/friends, confidence in game chaos, passing combinations, 2v1/2v2/3v3

Add a “Not sure what’s best?” CTA leading to Schedule a Call.

Pricing: keep as “inquire” by default.

“Pricing varies by format and location — book a call and I’ll recommend the best setup.”
(Include optional commented-out pricing table structure for future.)

About / Philosophy

Write as parent-friendly story, not a resume.
Include a headline like:

“A coach who builds confident players — and keeps the joy in the game.”

Include:

Inquiry-based coaching: players learn to think, not just follow instructions

Balance encouragement + high standards

Emphasis on translating skills into games

Add: “What a session looks like” bullets:

Warm-up + ball mastery

Skill work with constraints

Game-like scenarios

Quick recap + next steps
